## Contents

- **Data**: Contains tensor data for MPR analysis
- **Notebooks**: 
  - `MPR_Simulation.ipynb`: Main simulation notebook
  - `AOs_MPR.ipynb`: Analysis of Artificial Organisms
- **Visualizations**:
  - `mpr_stability_dashboard.html`: Interactive stability dashboard

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies (if any)
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks

## Branch Management

This repository uses two main branches:
- `main`: Production-ready code and stable releases
- `dev`: Development branch for ongoing work

### Workflow
1. Create feature branches from `dev` for new features or changes
2. Merge feature branches back into `dev` when complete
3. Merge `dev` into `main` for releases
